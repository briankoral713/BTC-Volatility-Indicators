# 📈 Key Indicators for Observing Bitcoin’s Volatility Landscape

## Project Summary
This project explores how to observe and interpret **forward-looking volatility in the Bitcoin market** using derivatives data—specifically implied volatility from Bitcoin options.

The original research paper (PDF included) was written as part of my work as a Derivatives Strategist at Austere Capital. It presents a real-world framework for analyzing market sentiment and risk, drawing from both traditional finance (VIX, Black-Scholes) and the emerging digital asset space.
